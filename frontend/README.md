## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Firebase authentication in a React application. It includes the ability for users to:

- Sign up and sign in with email/password.
- Sign in with Google.
- Automatically redirect users to the home page once authenticated.

It also uses Firebase's `auth` module to manage authentication and `React Router` to navigate between views.
